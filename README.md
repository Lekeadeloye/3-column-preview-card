## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used this challenge to build upon my existing knowledge of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and React especially. I took it as an opportunity to get some practice with using props to pass information between components. I also learnt how to render SVG's in React as a component. I also learnt how to use the .map() function to render multiple components to save from repeating code.


### Continued development

I will continue to practice passing information between components using props, but this time I will use object destructuring rathe than the props.propName syntax. I will also practice with conditional rendering and using React Hooks.
